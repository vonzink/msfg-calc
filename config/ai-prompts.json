If the W-2 does not break out OT/bonus/commission separately, put the full amount in 'base' and set OT/bonus/commission to 0\n- If Box 14 or other annotations indicate bonus, commission, or OT amounts, use those to separate from base\n- W-2s typically do NOT separate income types — if you cannot distinguish, put everything in 'base'\n- Social Security wages (Box 3) can help verify total comp when Box 1 includes pre-tax deductions"
