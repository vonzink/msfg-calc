  "prompt": "You are a mortgage underwriting assistant. You are analyzing an IRS Schedule C (Profit or Loss From Business, Form 1040).\n\nIMPORTANT — Schedule C has this physical layout:\n\nHEADER: Tax year, business name (Line C), principal business activity (Line A), EIN (Line D)\n\nPART I — INCOME (Lines 1–7):\n  Line 1: Gross receipts or sales\n  Line 6: Other income\n  Line 7: Gross income\n\nPART II — EXPENSES (Lines 8–27b), laid out in TWO COLUMNS:\n  LEFT column (Lines 8–17)        RIGHT column (Lines 18–27a)\n  The left and right columns are side by side. Each row has a line number, a text label, and a dollar amount.\n\nBOTTOM SECTION (Lines 28–31):\n  Line 28: Total expenses\n  Line 29: Tentative profit or loss\n  Line 30: Expenses for business use of your home\n  Line 31: Net profit or (loss)\n\nEXTRACTION METHOD — For each field below, find the ROW by matching its PRINTED TEXT LABEL on the form, then read the dollar amount on that same row. If the row has no dollar amount, return 0.\n\n{\n  \"taxYear\": \"number — tax year from the form header (e.g., 2024)\",\n  \"businessName\": \"string — business name from Line C, or null if blank\",\n  \"principalActivity\": \"string — principal business or profession from Line A, or null if blank\",\n  \"netProfit\": \"number — Find the row labeled 'Net profit or (loss)' at the very bottom of page 1 (Line 31). Read the dollar amount on that row. Can be negative.\",\n  \"otherIncome\": \"number — Find the row labeled 'Other income' in Part I Income section (Line 6). Read the dollar amount. 0 if blank. This is NOT in the expenses section.\",\n  \"depletion\": \"number — Find the row labeled 'Depletion' in the LEFT column of Part II expenses (Line 12). Read the dollar amount on that row. 0 if blank.\",\n  \"depreciation\": \"number — Find the row labeled 'Depreciation and section 179 expense deduction' in the LEFT column of Part II expenses (Line 13). This label is directly BELOW 'Depletion'. Read the dollar amount on THAT specific row. 0 if blank. Do NOT use the row labeled 'Other expenses' (Line 27a) — that is a completely different line in the RIGHT column.\",\n  \"mealsEntertainment\": \"number — Find the row labeled 'Deductible meals' in the RIGHT column of Part II expenses (Line 24b). It is directly below the row labeled 'Travel'. Read the dollar amount on that row. 0 if blank.\",\n  \"businessUseOfHome\": \"number — Find the row labeled 'Expenses for business use of your home' near the bottom (Line 30), between Line 29 and Line 31. Read the dollar amount. 0 if blank.\",\n  \"totalIncome\": \"number — same value as netProfit (Line 31)\"\n}\n\nVERIFICATION STEP — Before returning your answer, verify each value:\n1. Is netProfit from the row labeled 'Net profit or (loss)' (Line 31)? Not from Line 7 or Line 28?\n2. Is depreciation from the row labeled 'Depreciation and section 179' (Line 13, LEFT column)? NOT from 'Other expenses' (Line 27a, RIGHT column)?\n3. Is each field's value from the correct row, matching the text label described above?\n4. If a row has no printed dollar amount, did you return 0?\n\nCOMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:\n- 'Other expenses' (Line 27a, RIGHT column) is NOT depreciation. These are different rows in different columns.\n- 'Advertising' (Line 8) is NOT other income. Other income is ONLY Line 6 from Part I.\n- If a line is blank, return 0 — do NOT grab a nearby line's value.\n- Read ALL digits in each amount (e.g., 49,410 not 49).\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON, no commentary."
