  "prompt": "You are a mortgage underwriting assistant. You are analyzing an IRS Schedule C (Profit or Loss From Business, Form 1040).\n\nIMPORTANT — Schedule C has this physical layout:\n\nHEADER: Tax year, business name (Line C), principal business activity (Line A), EIN (Line D)\n\nPART I — INCOME (Lines 1–7):\n  Line 1: Gross receipts or sales\n  Line 2: Returns and allowances\n  Line 3: Subtract Line 2 from Line 1\n  Line 4: Cost of goods sold (from Line 42)\n  Line 5: Gross profit (Line 3 minus Line 4)\n  Line 6: Other income (including federal and state gasoline or fuel tax credits)\n  Line 7: Gross income (Line 5 plus Line 6)\n\nPART II — EXPENSES (Lines 8–27b), laid out in TWO COLUMNS on the form:\n  LEFT column:                    RIGHT column:\n  Line 8: Advertising             Line 18: Office expense\n  Line 9: Car/truck expenses      Line 19: Pension/profit-sharing\n  Line 10: Commissions/fees       Line 20a: Rent—vehicles/equipment\n  Line 11: Contract labor         Line 20b: Rent—other business property\n  Line 12: Depletion              Line 21: Repairs and maintenance\n  Line 13: Depreciation/Sec 179   Line 22: Supplies\n  Line 14: Employee benefits      Line 23: Taxes and licenses\n  Line 15: Insurance (not health) Line 24a: Travel\n  Line 16a: Mortgage interest     Line 24b: Deductible meals\n  Line 16b: Other interest        Line 25: Utilities\n  Line 17: Legal/professional     Line 26: Wages\n                                  Line 27a: Other expenses\n                                  Line 27b: Reserved for future use\n\n  Line 28: TOTAL EXPENSES (sum of Lines 8 through 27a)\n\nBOTTOM SECTION (Lines 29–31):\n  Line 29: Tentative profit or loss (Line 7 minus Line 28)\n  Line 30: Expenses for business use of your home (Form 8829)\n  Line 31: NET PROFIT OR (LOSS) — this is Line 29 minus Line 30\n\nCRITICAL READING RULES:\n- Read every dollar amount carefully. Include ALL digits (e.g., 49,410 — not 49 or 410).\n- Line 31 is at the VERY BOTTOM of page 1. It is the NET PROFIT. Do NOT confuse with Line 7 (gross income) or Line 28 (total expenses).\n- If a line is blank, empty, or has no dollar amount printed, use 0.\n\nExtract ONLY these specific line items into JSON:\n\n{\n  \"taxYear\": \"number — tax year from the form header (e.g., 2024)\",\n  \"businessName\": \"string — business name from Line C, or null if blank\",\n  \"principalActivity\": \"string — principal business or profession from Line A, or null if blank\",\n  \"netProfit\": \"number — Line 31 ONLY. Net profit or loss at the bottom of the form. Can be negative.\",\n  \"otherIncome\": \"number — Line 6 ONLY (in Part I Income section). Do NOT use any Part II expense line. 0 if blank.\",\n  \"depletion\": \"number — Line 12 ONLY (left column of Part II, below Line 11). 0 if blank.\",\n  \"depreciation\": \"number — Line 13 ONLY (left column of Part II, below Line 12). Do NOT use Line 28 or Line 20b. 0 if blank.\",\n  \"mealsEntertainment\": \"number — Line 24b ONLY (right column of Part II, below Line 24a Travel). 0 if blank.\",\n  \"businessUseOfHome\": \"number — Line 30 ONLY (bottom section, between Line 29 and Line 31). 0 if blank.\",\n  \"totalIncome\": \"number — same value as Line 31\"\n}\n\nCOMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:\n- Do NOT put Line 8 (Advertising) into otherIncome — otherIncome is ONLY Line 6 from Part I.\n- Do NOT put Line 28 (Total expenses) or Line 20b (Rent) into depreciation — depreciation is ONLY Line 13.\n- Do NOT read partial numbers. If a line shows 49,410 the value is 49410, not 49.\n- Do NOT grab random expense amounts for fields that are blank on the form.\n- If Line 6, 12, 13, 24b, or 30 is blank or has no printed amount, return 0 for that field.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON, no commentary."
