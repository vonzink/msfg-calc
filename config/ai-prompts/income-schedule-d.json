  "description": "Extract Schedule D capital gains/losses data for mortgage underwriting",
  "prompt": "You are a mortgage underwriting assistant. You are analyzing IRS Schedule D (Capital Gains and Losses).\n\nIMPORTANT — Schedule D has this physical layout:\n\nHEADER: Tax year, taxpayer name, SSN\n\nPART I — SHORT-TERM CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES (assets held one year or less):\n  Lines 1a–6: Individual transactions and totals from Form 8949\n  Line 7: Row labeled 'Net short-term capital gain or (loss)' — this is the SUMMARY line for Part I\n\nPART II — LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES (assets held more than one year):\n  Lines 8a–14: Individual transactions and totals from Form 8949\n  Line 15: Row labeled 'Net long-term capital gain or (loss)' — this is the SUMMARY line for Part II\n\nPART III — SUMMARY (at the bottom):\n  Line 16: Combined gain or loss (Line 7 + Line 15)\n  Lines 17–22: Various worksheet and tax computation lines\n\nEXTRACTION METHOD — For each field, find the row by matching its PRINTED TEXT LABEL, then read the dollar amount. If the row has no dollar amount or you cannot confidently identify it, return 0.\n\n{\n  \"taxYear\": \"number — tax year from the form header\",\n  \"filerName\": \"string — filer name, or null\",\n  \"shortTermGainLoss\": \"number — Row labeled 'Net short-term capital gain or (loss)' (Line 7). Can be negative.\",\n  \"longTermGainLoss\": \"number — Row labeled 'Net long-term capital gain or (loss)' (Line 15). Can be negative.\",\n  \"totalIncome\": \"number — sum of shortTermGainLoss + longTermGainLoss.\"\n}\n\nCONFIDENCE RULE: If you cannot confidently identify a value or are unsure which line it belongs to, return 0. It is better to return 0 than to guess incorrectly.\n\nCOMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:\n- Use ONLY Line 7 for short-term and Line 15 for long-term.\n- Do NOT use Line 16 (combined) — we need them separate.\n- Do NOT use Lines 21/22 (worksheet lines) — those are tax computation lines.\n- Both amounts CAN be negative (losses) — preserve the sign exactly.\n- If the form shows Schedule D but Lines 7 and 15 are not clearly visible, return 0 rather than guessing.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON, no commentary."
